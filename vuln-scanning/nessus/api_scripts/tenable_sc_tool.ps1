For this option I’m going to use an encrypted file with an AES key where I store the API user password for my Tenable.sc server.

You can use an encrypted file with no ‘key’ parameter as well, this will use you user credentials instead of the AES key. In this case, only the same user in the same machine can decrypt the file. If you want to fully automate API scripts, this is not the way.

The following steps are done only once, then we access the files from our scripts. We create the AES key and save it for later decryption:
#>
$AESkey = New-Object Byte[] 32
[Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider]::Create().GetBytes($AESkey)
$AESkey | Out-File 'C:\creds\aeskey.key'

#In the next step you’ll be prompted for your user password. It’s stored in an encrypted file - encrypt.xml. Remember to use a read only user if you don’t need to make changes through API.

Read-Host -AsSecureString | ConvertFrom-SecureString -key $AESkey | Out-File 'C:\creds\encrypt.xml'
