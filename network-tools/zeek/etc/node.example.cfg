# Example ZeekControl node configuration.
#
# This example has a standalone node ready to go except for possibly changing
# the sniffing interface.

# This is a complete standalone configuration.  Most likely you will
# only need to change the interface.
#[zeek]
#type=standalone
#host=localhost
#interface=eth0

## Below is an example clustered configuration. If you use this,
## remove the [zeek] node above.

[manager]
type=manager
host=localhost

[proxy-1]
type=proxy
host=localhost

[worker-1]
type=worker
host=localhost
# Change eth0 to match your capture interface
interface=af_packet::eth0
lb_method=custom
# Change based on the number of cores you want to dedicate to worker processes
lb_procs=4
# Uncomment and modify if you need to squeeze out even more performance.
#pin_cpus=0,1,2,3,4
# Optional parameters for per node configuration:
af_packet_fanout_id=23
af_packet_fanout_mode=AF_Packet::FANOUT_HASH
af_packet_buffer_size=128*1024*1024
