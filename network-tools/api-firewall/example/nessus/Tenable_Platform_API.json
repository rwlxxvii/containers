Use the API to get agent configuration details and update agent configurations.\n\nFor background information, see [Tenable.io Vulnerability Management User Guide](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Platform/Settings/Sensors/AgentSettings.htm)."},{"name":"Agent Exclusions","description":"With agent exclusions, you can prevent agents from receiving software updates at specified times. Use the API to perform a standard set of CRUD operations on agent exclusion objects.\n\nFor background information about agent exclusions, also known as blackout windows, see [Tenable.io Vulnerability Management User Guide](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Platform/Settings/Sensors/FreezeWindows.htm)."},{"name":"Agent Groups","description":"With agent groups, you can organize and manage the agents linked to your Tenable.io account. Use the API to add an agent to more than one agent group, and configure scans to use agent groups as targets.\n\nFor background information about agent groups, see [Tenable.io Vulnerability Management User Guide](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Platform/Settings/Sensors/CreateAnAgentGroup.htm)."},{"name":"Agents","description":"Nessus Agents are lightweight, low-footprint programs that you install locally on hosts to supplement traditional network-based scanning or to provide visibility into gaps that are missed by traditional scanning. Nessus Agents collect vulnerability, compliance, and system data, and report that information back to Tenable.io for analysis.\n\nUse the API to list available agents, get agent details, and unlink agents.\n\nFor background information about managing agents, see [Tenable.io Vulnerability Management User Guide](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Platform/Settings/Sensors/Agents.htm)."},{"name":"Agent Bulk Operations","description":"With agent bulk operations, you can asynchronously perform actions on multiple agents in an agent group. Use the API to add agents to an agent group, remove agents from an agent group, unlink agents from an agent group, and check the status of asynchronous agent operations. \n\nFor background information about managing agents, see [Tenable.io Vulnerability Management User Guide](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Platform/Settings/Sensors/Agents.htm)."},{"name":"Access Control","description":""},{"name":"Connectors","description":"With third-party data connectors, you can import assets from other platforms into Tenable.io. Tenable.io supports programmatic interaction with the following connectors:\n\n- Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n- Microsoft Azure\n- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\n\nUse the API to perform a standard set of CRUD operation on connector objects, and then use the connectors to import asset data by scheduling or running on-demand import jobs.

When you assign users to a group, the users inherit the permissions assigned to the group. Use the API to perform standard CRUD operations on group objects, and also to manage users in groups.\n\nFor background information about groups, see [Tenable.io Vulnerability Management User Guide](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Platform/Settings/AccessControl/Groups.htm)."},{"name":"Users","description":"User accounts enable you to provide access to Tenable.io and manage permissions for Tenable.io resources.
