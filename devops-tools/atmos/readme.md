## geodisec shell

Geodesic is the fastest way to get up and running with a rock solid, production grade cloud platform built entirely from Open Source technologies.

Itâ€™s a swiss army knife for creating and building consistent platforms to be shared across a team environment.

It easily versions staging environments in a repeatable manner that can be followed by any team member.

```sh

docker|podman run -it --rm --volume $HOME:/localhost docker.io/cloudposse/geodesic:latest-debian --login

# Geodesic version 2.8.0 based on Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) (11.8)
